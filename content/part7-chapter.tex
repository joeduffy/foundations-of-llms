The years 2021-2022 focused on making large language models more efficient, aligned with human values, and capable of complex reasoning. The field recognized that raw scale alone was insufficient—models needed to be deployable, controllable, and capable of systematic reasoning.

Efficiency improvements addressed practical deployment challenges. \hyperref[paper:hu-2021]{LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)} demonstrated that large models could be efficiently adapted by training only low-rank decompositions, making fine-tuning accessible and practical for resource-constrained environments. Architectural improvements included \hyperref[paper:su-2021]{RoFormer (Su et al., 2021)} with rotary position embeddings and \hyperref[paper:press-2021]{ALiBi (Press et al., 2021)}, which enabled extrapolation to longer sequences without retraining. \hyperref[paper:dao-2022]{FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022)} provided fast, memory-efficient exact attention computation, while \hyperref[paper:fedus-2022]{Switch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2022)} demonstrated trillion-parameter sparse models where each token activates only a fraction of the model's capacity.

Knowledge integration was advanced through \hyperref[paper:borgeaud-2021]{RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2021)}, which scaled retrieval-augmented models to trillions of tokens, and \hyperref[paper:hoffmann-2022]{Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022)}, which established compute-optimal training laws showing that many models were undertrained relative to their size.

Alignment breakthroughs made models more helpful and harmless. \hyperref[paper:ouyang-2022]{InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022)} demonstrated that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) could align models with human preferences, producing more helpful and harmless outputs. \hyperref[paper:bai-2022]{Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022)} introduced training methods using AI feedback to improve harmlessness while reducing reliance on human annotation.

Reasoning capabilities emerged through prompting innovations. \hyperref[paper:wei-2022]{Chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022)} showed that proper prompting could elicit step-by-step reasoning, dramatically improving performance on complex tasks. \hyperref[paper:yao-2022]{ReAct (Yao et al., 2022)} created a framework combining reasoning and acting for complex task solving, demonstrating how language models could interleave thought and action in problem-solving scenarios.
