This appendix covers the foundational papers for AI agents---systems that use large language models to reason, plan, and act autonomously. Agents extend language models from text generation to goal-directed interaction with external environments. The core technical challenges include grounding language in executable actions, learning tool use without exhaustive supervision, and planning over long horizons with error recovery.
