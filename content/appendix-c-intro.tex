Production systems integrate the techniques documented in this volume into deployable models. This appendix presents technical reports that introduced qualitatively new capabilities or architectural innovations with broad impact on subsequent work.

\section*{Reports in This Appendix}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{OpenAI (2023)} --- GPT-4: first widely-deployed multimodal frontier model, establishing new capability baselines across reasoning, factual accuracy, and instruction-following.

\item \textbf{DeepMind (2024)} --- Gemini 1.5: context windows exceeding one million tokens through efficient attention mechanisms, enabling processing of book-length inputs.

\item \textbf{DeepSeek-AI (2024)} --- DeepSeek-V3: 671B mixture-of-experts with auxiliary-loss-free routing and multi-head latent attention, achieving order-of-magnitude training efficiency gains.

\item \textbf{OpenAI (2024)} --- o1 System Card: extended chain-of-thought reasoning through reinforcement learning, demonstrating the test-time compute paradigm.

\item \textbf{DeepSeek-AI (2025)} --- DeepSeek-R1: pure reinforcement learning teaches reasoning without supervised fine-tuning, with open weights enabling research into reasoning model internals.

\item \textbf{OpenAI (2025)} --- GPT-5: unified system with a learned real-time router dispatching between a fast model and a deep reasoning model, representing a new production architecture for adaptive inference.
